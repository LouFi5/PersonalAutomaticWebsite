# PersonalAutomaticWebsite

# Hi there and welcome. This app is rather simple, but if you fill the form in contact section, the website will send
# me a text and an email, and it will send you a text and an email with PDF containing your message. It demonstrates my
# ability to work with APIs and some basic python functionalities. Section #1 is devoted to website basic
# functionalities. Section #2 is devoted to sending emails, SMSs and creating PDF. The FE was created by
# www.mashup-template.com. || Dont forget to add your own name, gmail (+another email), tel and Twilio keys and number,
# use ctrl + f and seek for 'ADD_YOUR_OWN_DATA!' in this code ||
